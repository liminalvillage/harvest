# Feature Specification: Holon DNA Editor

**Feature Branch**: `001-holon-dna-editor`
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "i would like to create a beautiful DNA editing interface, where the holon can specity its sets of values, tools and practices form a growing library of chromosomes. The combination defines the chromosome. Let it be possible to reorder the dna. Save it to the holosphere. In this way the rules of conduct and practices of the holon are clear, both internally and externally"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View and Select Chromosomes from Library (Priority: P1)

A holon administrator wants to browse available values, tools, and practices from a growing library and select the ones that define their holon's identity and operational principles.

**Why this priority**: This is the foundation of the DNA editing feature - users need to see what's available before they can build their holon's DNA. Without this capability, no other functionality is possible.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading the chromosome library interface and selecting individual chromosomes. Delivers immediate value by allowing users to explore and understand available governance options.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a holon administrator is viewing the DNA editor, **When** they open the chromosome library, **Then** they see a categorized list of available values, tools, and practices
2. **Given** the chromosome library is open, **When** the administrator selects a chromosome from any category (values/tools/practices), **Then** the chromosome is added to the holon's DNA sequence
3. **Given** multiple chromosomes are available in the library, **When** the administrator views them, **Then** each chromosome displays a clear description of what it represents
4. **Given** the chromosome library, **When** new chromosomes are added to the system, **Then** they automatically appear in the library for selection

### User Story 2 - Compose and Reorder DNA Sequence (Priority: P2)

A holon administrator wants to arrange their selected chromosomes in a meaningful order and adjust the sequence to reflect the priority and structure of their holon's governance.

**Why this priority**: After selecting chromosomes, users need to organize them logically. The order reflects importance and relationships between governance elements.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by adding several chromosomes and dragging them to reorder. Delivers value by allowing holons to express their governance priorities through sequence.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a holon has selected multiple chromosomes, **When** the administrator drags a chromosome to a new position, **Then** the DNA sequence updates to reflect the new order
2. **Given** a DNA sequence with multiple chromosomes, **When** the administrator removes a chromosome, **Then** the remaining chromosomes maintain their relative order
3. **Given** a partially built DNA sequence, **When** the administrator adds a new chromosome, **Then** they can choose where to insert it in the sequence
4. **Given** an active DNA editing session, **When** the administrator views the sequence, **Then** the visual representation clearly shows the order and relationships between chromosomes

---

### User Story 3 - Save and Persist DNA to Holosphere (Priority: P3)

A holon administrator wants to save their composed DNA sequence to the holosphere so it persists across sessions and is accessible to the holon network.

**Why this priority**: Persistence ensures work isn't lost and makes the DNA available for internal operations and external visibility. This completes the core workflow.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by composing a DNA sequence, saving it, closing the interface, and verifying it reloads correctly. Delivers value by making DNA configurations permanent and shareable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a holon administrator has composed a DNA sequence, **When** they save it, **Then** the data is persisted to the holosphere under the holon's identity
2. **Given** a saved DNA sequence, **When** the administrator reopens the DNA editor, **Then** their previously saved sequence is loaded and displayed
3. **Given** a DNA sequence saved to the holosphere, **When** other holons query this holon's DNA, **Then** they can view the values, tools, and practices that define this holon
4. **Given** multiple save operations, **When** the administrator saves changes, **Then** the holosphere updates with the latest version while maintaining data integrity

---

### User Story 4 - View DNA in Beautiful Visual Interface (Priority: P4)

A holon administrator wants to see their DNA sequence displayed in an aesthetically pleasing, intuitive interface that makes governance rules clear and engaging.

**Why this priority**: A beautiful interface improves user experience and makes complex governance structures more understandable. This is polish that enhances adoption.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by composing a DNA sequence and evaluating the visual presentation. Delivers value through improved clarity and user engagement.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a holon has a DNA sequence, **When** the administrator views it in the editor, **Then** the interface displays chromosomes in a visually appealing, DNA-inspired layout
2. **Given** different types of chromosomes (values/tools/practices), **When** displayed in the editor, **Then** each type is visually distinguished with appropriate colors, icons, or styling
3. **Given** a long DNA sequence, **When** viewing in the editor, **Then** the interface provides smooth scrolling and maintains readability
4. **Given** chromosome details, **When** the administrator hovers or selects a chromosome, **Then** additional information is displayed in a clear, non-intrusive way

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a holon tries to save DNA without an active holosphere connection? System should queue the save operation and retry when connection is restored, providing clear feedback to the user.
- What happens when two administrators edit the same holon's DNA simultaneously? System uses last-write-wins: both editors can work independently, the last to save wins, and the other editor receives a warning notification that their changes were overwritten with the option to review the current state.
- What happens when the chromosome library is empty? System should provide guidance on how to populate the library or display a meaningful empty state.
- What happens when a user tries to add more than 20 chromosomes to a DNA sequence? System prevents adding additional chromosomes and displays a clear message indicating the maximum limit has been reached, suggesting removal of existing chromosomes if changes are needed.
- What happens when a user tries to add a chromosome that's already in the DNA sequence? System prevents the duplicate addition and displays a message indicating the chromosome is already present in the sequence, highlighting its current position.
- What happens when a chromosome that's part of a holon's DNA is removed from the library? The DNA sequence should retain the chromosome data but mark it as archived or legacy.
- What happens when loading a DNA sequence with corrupted or invalid data from holosphere? System should attempt to recover valid portions and flag issues for administrator review.

- **FR-016**: System MUST allow holon administrators to add, edit, and remove chromosomes in their holon's library
- **FR-017**: System MUST persist each holon's chromosome library to the holosphere independently

### Key Entities

- **Chromosome**: Represents a single governance element (value, tool, or practice) with attributes including name, type (values/tools/practices), description, and unique identifier. Can exist in the library and be referenced in multiple holon DNA sequences.

- **DNA Sequence**: Represents the ordered collection of unique chromosomes that define a holon's governance structure. Contains attributes including holon identifier, ordered list of unique chromosome references (maximum 20, no duplicates), creation timestamp, and last modified timestamp. Persisted to holosphere.

- **Holon**: The entity whose rules of conduct and practices are being defined. Each holon has exactly one DNA sequence that represents its governance configuration.

- **Chromosome Library**: A holon-specific repository of available chromosomes. Each holon maintains its own library containing values, tools, and practices that can be used to compose that holon's DNA. Managed by holon administrators and persisted to holosphere independently per holon.
