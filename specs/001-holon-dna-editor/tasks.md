# Tasks: Holon DNA Editor

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-holon-dna-editor/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are NOT explicitly requested in the feature specification. Test tasks have been excluded per template guidelines.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/`, `doc/` at repository root
- Paths shown below follow SvelteKit conventions per plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [X] T001 Install svelte-dnd-action dependency via npm

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Story 1 (Phase 3)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (Phase 4)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Builds on User Story 1 (DNASequence component)
- **User Story 3 (Phase 5)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Builds on User Story 1 and 2
- **User Story 4 (Phase 6)**: Depends on Foundational phase completion - Enhances all previous stories
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Modifies DNASequence component from US1 but can be developed independently in parallel
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Uses components from US1/US2 but adds separate save functionality
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Purely visual enhancements, can be developed in parallel

### Within Each User Story

- Components marked [P] can run in parallel (different files)
- Foundation tasks (T008-T019) must complete before user story work
- US1 components can be built in parallel: ChromosomeCard, ChromosomeLibrary (basics), DNASequence (basics)
- US2 builds on DNASequence but can be developed independently
- US3 adds save logic independently
- US4 adds visual polish independently

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T002, T003, T004 can run in parallel (different files)
- **Setup (Phase 1)**: T006, T007 can run in parallel
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: T018, T019 can run in parallel
- **User Story 1**: T020, T021, T025 can run in parallel (separate components)
- **User Story 4**: T062, T063, T064 can run in parallel (visual enhancements)
- **Polish**: T075, T076, T077, T079, T080 can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch foundational infrastructure tasks together:
Task: "Create validation logic in src/lib/dna/validation.ts"
Task: "Create Svelte stores in src/lib/stores/dna-editor.ts"
Task: "Create error utilities in src/lib/dna/errors.ts"

# Then launch US1 component tasks together:
Task: "Create ChromosomeCard in src/components/ChromosomeCard.svelte"
Task: "Create ChromosomeLibrary in src/components/ChromosomeLibrary.svelte"
Task: "Create DNASequence in src/components/DNASequence.svelte"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T019) - CRITICAL - blocks all stories
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T020-T035)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
   - Load editor for a holon
   - Verify library displays with categories
   - Select chromosomes
   - Verify they appear in DNA sequence
   - Remove chromosomes
   - Verify empty states
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test drag-and-drop ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test persistence and offline ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test visual polish ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (T001-T019)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (T020-T035) - Core selection UI
   - Developer B: User Story 2 (T036-T045) - Drag-and-drop (after US1 components exist)
   - Developer C: User Story 3 (T046-T061) - Persistence (after US1 components exist)
   - Developer D: User Story 4 (T062-T074) - Visual polish (can start in parallel)
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Tests are not included as they were not explicitly requested in spec.md
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
