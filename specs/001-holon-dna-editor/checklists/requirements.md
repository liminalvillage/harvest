# Specification Quality Checklist: Holon DNA Editor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items passed. The specification is complete and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`).

### Validation Details

**Content Quality**: Specification focuses on user needs (holon administrators composing DNA sequences) without mentioning specific technologies. Uses the DNA metaphor effectively to describe governance structures.

**Requirement Completeness**: All 13 functional requirements are testable and unambiguous. Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "under 5 minutes", "99.9% reliability", "within 2 seconds"). Edge cases cover connection failures, concurrent editing, empty states, and data corruption. Scope is bounded with clear "Out of Scope" items.

**Feature Readiness**: Four user stories are prioritized (P1-P4) and independently testable. Each story has clear acceptance scenarios using Given-When-Then format. The MVP (P1) delivers immediate value through chromosome library browsing.
