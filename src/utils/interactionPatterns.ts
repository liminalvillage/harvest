      questionPrompt: `You are conducting a vision clarification interview to help transform their vision into a specific, actionable S.M.A.R.T. objective. Focus your questions on clarifying:

**S.M.A.R.T. FRAMEWORK FOCUS:**
- **Specific**: What exactly will is the vision - help frame it more clearly. What are the desired outcomes, exactly?
- **Measurable**: How will success be measured? What are the quantifiable indicators?
- **Achievable**: What makes this realistic? What resources, skills, and support are needed?
- **Relevant**: Why does this matter now? How does it align with their values and larger purpose?
- **Time-bound**: What are the key milestones and deadlines? When will this be achieved?

**IMPORTANT**: Each advisor should ask questions that:
- Directly help define ONE aspect of the S.M.A.R.T. framework
- Reflect their unique expertise, perspective, and speaking style
- Drive toward concrete, actionable clarity (not just philosophical exploration)
- Help identify specific success metrics, constraints, stakeholders, and implementation steps

Generate exactly 3 questions from 3 different advisors, each focusing on different S.M.A.R.T. components, starting with specifying the precise objective, and speaking authentically in their documented voice and style.`

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
1. You MUST use the exact advisorId values shown above: "${advisors[0].id}", "${advisors[1].id}", "${advisors[2].id}"
2. Do NOT change these IDs or make up new ones
3. Do NOT use "undefined" or any other value
4. Each question must have the exact advisorId from the list above

Each question should:
- **Embody the advisor's authentic voice**: Use their documented speaking style, personality traits, and approach to advice
- **Focus on S.M.A.R.T. clarity**: Drive toward specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound details
- **Leverage their expertise**: Draw from their unique lens and knowledge domains
- **Be actionable**: Help identify concrete steps, metrics, resources, and timelines (not just philosophical insights)
- **Reflect their character**: Reference their key beliefs, background, or notable perspectives naturally

**VOICE AUTHENTICITY**: Each advisor should sound distinctly like themselves - use their documented speaking patterns, characteristic phrases, and approach to advice. Avoid generic interviewer questions.`;
